A01 0010  1       The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation
A01 0020  1    of Atlanta's recent primary election produced "no evidence"
A01 0020  9    that any irregularities took place.
A01 0030  5       The jury further said in term-end presentments that
A01 0040  3    the City Executive Committee, which had over-all charge
A01 0050  2    of the election, "deserves the praise and thanks of
A01 0050 11    the City of Atlanta" for the manner in which the election
A01 0060 11    was conducted.
A01 0070  1       The September-October term jury had been charged
A01 0070  9    by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate
A01 0080  8    reports of possible "irregularities" in the hard-fought
A01 0090  6    primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen
A01 0100  5    Jr.
A01 0100  6       "Only a relative handful of such reports was received",
A01 0110  6    the jury said, "considering the widespread interest
A01 0120  3    in the election, the number of voters and the size
A01 0130  1    of this city".
A01 0130  4       The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's
A01 0140  1    registration and election laws "are outmoded or inadequate
A01 0150  1    and often ambiguous".
A01 0150  4       It recommended that Fulton legislators act "to have
A01 0160  4    these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing
A01 0170  1    and improving them".
A01 0170  4       The grand jury commented on a number of other topics,
A01 0180  4    among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing
A01 0190  1    departments which it said "are well operated and follow
A01 0190 10    generally accepted practices which inure to the best
A01 0200  8    interest of both governments".
A01 0210  1    #MERGER PROPOSED#
A01 0210  3    However, the jury said it believes "these two offices
A01 0220  3    should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and
A01 0220 11    reduce the cost of administration".
A01 0230  5       The City Purchasing Department, the jury said, "is
A01 0240  5    lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result
A01 0250  4    of city personnel policies". It urged that the city
A01 0250 13    "take steps to remedy" this problem.
A01 0260  6       Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law
A01 0270  4    was also recommended by the outgoing jury.
A01 0280  1       It urged that the next Legislature "provide enabling
A01 0280  9    funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly
A01 0290 11    implementation of the law may be effected".
A01 0300  6       The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare
A01 0310  3    Department's handling of federal funds granted for
A01 0320  1    child welfare services in foster homes.
A01 0320  7       "This is one of the major items in the Fulton County
A01 0330  7    general assistance program", the jury said, but the
A01 0340  5    State Welfare Department "has seen fit to distribute
A01 0350  1    these funds through the welfare departments of all
A01 0350  9    the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton
A01 0360  9    County, which receives none of this money.
A01 0370  5       The jurors said they realize "a proportionate distribution
A01 0380  2    of these funds might disable this program in our less
A01 0390  1    populous counties".
A01 0390  3       Nevertheless, "we feel that in the future Fulton
A01 0400  3    County should receive some portion of these available
A01 0410  1    funds", the jurors said. "Failure to do this will continue
A01 0410 11    to place a disproportionate burden" on Fulton taxpayers.
A01 0420  7       The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's
A01 0430  7    court which has been under fire for its practices in
A01 0440  6    the appointment of appraisers, guardians and administrators
A01 0450  2    and the awarding of fees and compensation.
A01 0450  9    #WARDS PROTECTED#
A01 0460  1    The jury said it found the court "has incorporated
A01 0460 10    into its operating procedures the recommendations"
A01 0470  6    of two previous grand juries, the Atlanta Bar Association
A01 0480  6    and an interim citizens committee.
A01 0490  1       "These actions should serve to protect in fact and
A01 0490 10    in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its
A01 0500  9    appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms",
A01 0510  5    the jury said.
A01 0510  8       Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport,
A01 0520  7    the jury recommended "that when the new management
A01 0530  6    takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner
A01 0540  6    that will eliminate political influences".
A01 0550  1       The jury did not elaborate, but it added that "there
A01 0550 11    should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices
A01 0560  8    of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the
A01 0570  7    prices reasonable".
A01 0570  9    #ASK JAIL DEPUTIES#
A01 0580  2    On other matters, the jury recommended that:
A01 0580  9    _(1)_
A01 0590  1       Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton
A01 0590  8    County Jail and "a doctor, medical intern or extern
A01 0600  7    be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail".
A01 0610  5    _(2)_
A01 0610  6       Fulton legislators "work with city officials to
A01 0620  3    pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment
A01 0630  1    of a fair and equitable" pension plan for city employes.
A01 0640  1       The jury praised the administration and operation
A01 0640  8    of the Atlanta Police Department, the Fulton Tax Commissioner's
A01 0650  7    Office, the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms, Grady
A01 0660  6    Hospital and the Fulton Health Department.
A01 0680  1       Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce
A01 0680  9    from his wife, Pearl Williams Hartsfield, in Fulton
A01 0695  6    Superior Court Friday. His petition charged mental
A01 0700  5    cruelty.
A01 0700  6       The couple was married Aug. 2, 1913. They have a
A01 0710  7    son, William Berry Jr., and a daughter, Mrs. J. M.
A01 0720  4    Cheshire of Griffin.
A01 0720  7       Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property
A01 0730  9    settlement has been agreed upon.
A01 0740  2       The petition listed the mayor's occupation as "attorney"
A01 0750  1    and his age as 71. It listed his wife's age as 74 and
A01 0750 14    place of birth as Opelika, Ala.
A01 0760  6       The petition said that the couple has not lived
A01 0770  4    together as man and wife for more than a year.
A01 0780  1       The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd. NE.
A01 0790  1       Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the
A01 0790 11    mayor's attorney.
A01 0800  1       Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta, with exception
A01 0810  1    of one brief interlude, since 1937. His political career
A01 0810 10    goes back to his election to city council in 1923.
A01 0820  8       The mayor's present term of office expires Jan.
A01 0830  6    1. He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr., who became
A01 0840  4    a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield
A01 0850  2    announced that he would not run for reelection.
A01 0860  1       Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement
A01 0860  7    to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a
A01 0870  9    top official said Wednesday.
A01 0880  1       Robert Snodgrass, state GOP chairman, said a meeting
A01 0890  1    held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic
A01 0890  9    responses from the audience.
A01 0900  4       State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that
A01 0910  3    enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held
A01 0910 14    Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen.
A01 0920 10    John Tower will be the featured speaker.
A01 0930  6       In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned
A01 0940  5    that entering a candidate for governor would force
A01 0950  1    it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain
A01 0950 11    the signatures of registered voters.
A01 0960  4       Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote
A01 0970  3    to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who
A01 0970 11    attended.
A01 0980  1       When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait
A01 0980 11    one more term to make the race, it voted no- and there
A01 0990 12    were no dissents.
A01 1000  1       The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to
A01 1000  9    face is a state law which says that before making a
A01 1010  9    first race, one of two alternative courses must be
A01 1020  4    taken:
A01 1020  5    _1._
A01 1020  6       Five per cent of the voters in each county must
A01 1030  5    sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed
A01 1040  2    to place names of candidates on the general election
A01 1040 11    ballot, or
A01 1050  2    _2._
A01 1050  3       The Republicans must hold a primary under the county
A01 1050 12    unit system- a system which the party opposes in its
A01 1060  9    platform.
A01 1070  1       Sam Caldwell, State Highway Department public relations
A01 1070  8    director, resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland
A01 1080  9    Byrd's campaign.
A01 1090  2       Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some
A01 1100  1    time. He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville,
A01 1100 11    who has been an assistant more than three years. When
A01 1110  9    the gubernatorial campaign starts, Caldwell is expected
A01 1120  5    to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd.
A01 1140  1       The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session
A01 1140 10    Monday and head for home- where some of the highway
A01 1150 10    bond money it approved will follow shortly.
A01 1160  4       Before adjournment Monday afternoon, the Senate
A01 1170  2    is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators
A01 1180  1    allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what
A01 1180 10    adjustments should be made.
A01 1190  3       Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional
A01 1200  1    visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment.
A01 1200 10    Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway
A01 1210  7    bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first
A01 1220  7    priority item.
A01 1220  9    #CONSTRUCTION BONDS#
A01 1220 11    Meanwhile, it was learned the State Highway Department
A01 1230  8    is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million
A01 1240  9    worth of highway reconstruction bonds.
A01 1250  2       The bond issue will go to the state courts for a
A01 1260  1    friendly test suit to test the validity of the act,
A01 1260 11    and then the sales will begin and contracts let for
A01 1270  7    repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled
A01 1280  4    highways.
A01 1280  5       A Highway Department source said there also is a
A01 1290  6    plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth
A01 1300  2    of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction
A01 1300 11    work.
A01 1310  1    #A REVOLVING FUND#
A01 1310  4    The department apparently intends to make the Rural
A01 1320  3    Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds
A01 1320 12    would be issued every time a portion of the old ones
A01 1330 11    are paid off by tax authorities.
A01 1340  2       Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with
A01 1350  1    a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of
A01 1350 10    $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed
A01 1360  7    by then Gov. Marvin Griffin.
A01 1370  2       The Highway Department source told The Constitution,
A01 1380  1    however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about
A01 1380 10    the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds.
A01 1400  1       Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution
A01 1410  1    Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of
A01 1410 11    Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense
A01 1420 10    allowances.
A01 1430  1       Pelham said Sunday night there was research being
A01 1430  8    done on whether the "quickie" vote on the increase
A01 1440  6    can be repealed outright or whether notice would have
A01 1450  4    to first be given that reconsideration of the action
A01 1460  1    would be sought.
A01 1460  4       While emphasizing that technical details were not
A01 1470  2    fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would
A01 1470 10    seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the
A01 1480  7    House voted through 87-31.
A01 1490  1       A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote
A01 1490 11    of 29-5. As of Sunday night, there was no word of a
A01 1500 11    resolution being offered there to rescind the action.
A01 1510  6       Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November
A01 1520  4    rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators
A01 1530  1    to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.
A01 1540  1       A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the
A01 1540  9    Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education,
A01 1550  8    something it has consistently opposed in the past.
A01 1560  5       Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House
A01 1570  4    in a privilege resolution to "endorse increased federal
A01 1580  1    support for public education, provided that such funds
A01 1580  9    be received and expended" as state funds.
A01 1590  6       Barber, who is in his 13th year as a legislator,
A01 1600  5    said there "are some members of our congressional delegation
A01 1610  2    in Washington who would like to see it (the resolution)
A01 1620  1    passed". But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen
A01 1620 10    specifically asked him to offer the resolution.
A01 1630  7       The resolution, which Barber tossed into the House
A01 1640  6    hopper Friday, will be formally read Monday. It says
A01 1645  4    that "in the event Congress does provide this increase
A01 1650  8    in federal funds", the State Board of Education should
A01 1660  6    be directed to "give priority" to teacher pay raises.
A01 1670  5    _COLQUITT_
A01 1670  6       - After a long, hot controversy, Miller County has
A01 1680  4    a new school superintendent, elected, as a policeman
A01 1690  2    put it, in the "coolest election I ever saw in this
A01 1690 13    county".
A01 1700  1       The new school superintendent is Harry Davis, a
A01 1700  9    veteran agriculture teacher, who defeated Felix Bush,
A01 1710  7    a school principal and chairman of the Miller County
A01 1720  6    Democratic Executive Committee.
A01 1730  1       Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election,
A01 1730  8    and Bush got 402. Ordinary Carey Williams, armed with
A01 1740  8    a pistol, stood by at the polls to insure order.
A01 1750  6       "This was the coolest, calmest election I ever saw",
A01 1760  5    Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said. "Being at the
A01 1770  3    polls was just like being at church. I didn't smell
A01 1780  1    a drop of liquor, and we didn't have a bit of trouble".
A01 1780 13       The campaign leading to the election was not so
A01 1790  9    quiet, however. It was marked by controversy, anonymous
A01 1800  5    midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence.
A01 1810  3       The former county school superintendent, George
A01 1820  1    P. Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days
A01 1820 11    after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county
A01 1830 10    school board.
A01 1840  1       During the election campaign, both candidates, Davis
A01 1840  7    and Bush, reportedly received anonymous telephone calls.
A01 1850  5    Ordinary Williams said he, too, was subjected to anonymous
A01 1860  6    calls soon after he scheduled the election.
A01 1870  1       Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities
A01 1880  1    at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to
A01 1880 11    carry a gun and promised an orderly election.
A01 1890  6       Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently
A01 1900  3    made good his promise.
A01 1900  7       "Everything went real smooth", the sheriff said.
A01 1910  6    "There wasn't a bit of trouble".
